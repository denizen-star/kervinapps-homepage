        <h1>What is Hunter? A Friendly Explanation</h1>
        
        <p>Hey friend! Let me tell you about this awesome app I built to help with my job search. It's called <strong>Hunter</strong>, and honestly, it's been a game-changer.</p>

        <h2>What Problem Does It Solve?</h2>

        <p>You know how job hunting can be absolutely exhausting? You're applying to dozens of jobs, each one wants a customized resume and cover letter, you're trying to track which companies you've applied to, what stage you're at, and you're constantly wondering: <em>"Do I even have a shot at this job?"</em></p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Well, Hunter solves all of that. And the best part? It's <strong>100% private</strong> - everything runs on my computer, so my resume and job info never goes to the cloud.</p>
        </div>

        <h2> What Does It Do?</h2>

        <p>Hunter is like having a personal AI assistant for your entire job search. Here's what it does:</p>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>1. <strong>Smart Job Matching</strong> </h3>
            <p>When I find a job posting I like, I just paste the job description into Hunter. The app uses AI to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extract all the requirements from the job (skills, experience, certifications)</li>
                <li>Compare them against my resume</li>
                <li>Give me a <strong>match score</strong> (0-100%) showing how good a fit I am</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So instead of wasting time on jobs where I'm clearly underqualified, I can focus on the ones where I have a real shot!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>2. <strong>Automatic Document Generation</strong> </h3>
            <p>Here's where it gets really cool. For each job, Hunter automatically creates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A customized cover letter</strong> that highlights the skills they're looking for</li>
                <li><strong>A tailored resume</strong> where my experience bullets are rewritten to match what the job wants</li>
                <li><strong>A qualification analysis</strong> showing exactly what I have vs. what they want</li>
                <li><strong>A beautiful summary page</strong> with everything organized in tabs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This saves me <strong>hours</strong> per application. No more manually tweaking my resume for each job!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>3. <strong>Application Tracking Dashboard</strong> </h3>
            <p>Hunter creates a gorgeous visual dashboard where I can see:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All my applications in one place</li>
                <li>Status of each (Pending, Applied, Interviewed, Offered, etc.)</li>
                <li>My match score for each job</li>
                <li>When I applied and last updated</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I can click on any application to see the full summary with all my generated documents.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>4. <strong>Technology Skills Matching</strong> </h3>
            <p>One of my favorite features! Hunter shows me a visual breakdown of technologies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Green pills</strong> 🟢 = I have this skill and they want it (perfect match!)</li>
                <li><strong>Yellow pills</strong> 🟡 = Partially matched or inferred</li>
                <li><strong>Red pills</strong> 🔴 = They want this but I don't have it (need to address this)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This instantly shows me where I'm strong and where I might need to emphasize related experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>5. <strong>Hiring Team Intelligence</strong> </h3>
            <p>When job postings include hiring team info (like from LinkedIn), Hunter extracts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Names and titles of the hiring team</li>
                <li>My connection degree to them (1st, 2nd, 3rd on LinkedIn)</li>
                <li>Their role (Job poster, Hiring manager, Interviewer, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This helps me figure out who to reach out to and if I have mutual connections!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>6. <strong>Status Updates & Notes</strong> </h3>
            <p>I can update the status of any application right from the summary page:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Applied" when I submit</li>
                <li>"Contacted Someone" when I reach out to the hiring manager</li>
                <li>"Interviewed" after phone screens</li>
                <li>Add notes about how things went</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Everything is tracked with timestamps so I can see my entire application journey.</p>
        </div>

        <h2> How Does It Work?</h2>

        <p>The magic behind Hunter is surprisingly simple:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>I paste a job description</strong> into the web interface</li>
            <li><strong>Local AI (Ollama)</strong> analyzes both the job and my resume
                <ul>
                    <li>It extracts all the requirements, skills, and qualifications</li>
                    <li>Compares them to what I have in my resume</li>
                    <li>Calculates a match score</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Generates all the documents</strong> automatically
                <ul>
                    <li>Custom cover letter</li>
                    <li>Tailored resume</li>
                    <li>Qualification analysis</li>
                    <li>Summary HTML page</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Everything saves locally</strong> in organized folders</li>
            <li><strong>Dashboard updates</strong> to show the new application</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>The whole process takes about 30-60 seconds, and then I have everything I need to apply!</p>
        </div>

        <h2> How Will This Help My Job Search?</h2>

        <h3>Time Savings </h3>
        <p>Before Hunter, I spent 1-2 hours per application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>30 min customizing my resume</li>
            <li>30 min writing a cover letter</li>
            <li>15 min tracking in a spreadsheet</li>
            <li>15 min researching the company</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>With Hunter:</strong> 5 minutes of my time (paste job description, review generated docs), and the rest happens automatically!</p>

        <h3>Better Applications </h3>
        <p>The AI helps me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speak their language:</strong> Uses keywords from the job description</li>
            <li><strong>Highlight relevant experience:</strong> Rewrites my bullets to match what they want</li>
            <li><strong>Address gaps:</strong> Shows me what skills I'm missing so I can address them in my cover letter</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on the right jobs:</strong> Match scores help me prioritize where I have the best chance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Organized & Professional </h3>
        <p>Instead of a messy spreadsheet, I have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A professional dashboard I can even show recruiters</li>
            <li>All documents for each job in one place</li>
            <li>Complete history of status updates and notes</li>
            <li>Easy tracking of my entire pipeline</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Confidence Boost </h3>
        <p>Seeing a 85% match score and having AI-generated documents that perfectly align with the job description? That's a huge confidence boost before clicking "Apply"!</p>

        <h3>Strategic Networking </h3>
        <p>The hiring team extraction helps me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Know who posted the job</li>
            <li>See if I have mutual connections</li>
            <li>Reach out strategically to the right people</li>
            <li>Build relationships before or after applying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Why Local AI Matters</h2>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>I use <strong>Ollama</strong> (a free, local AI) instead of ChatGPT or other cloud services. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ My resume stays 100% private on my computer</li>
                <li>✅ No API costs (it's completely free!)</li>
                <li>✅ No internet required after setup</li>
                <li>✅ Unlimited usage - no rate limits</li>
                <li>✅ Full control over my data</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2> Real Results</h2>

        <p>Since building Hunter, I've:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cut application time from 1-2 hours to 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Applied to 10 jobs in the same time it used to take for 1</li>
            <li>Increased my response rate (better targeted applications!)</li>
            <li>Never lost track of where I am in any process</li>
            <li>Reduced stress by having everything organized</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="bottom-line">
            <strong>Hunter is like having a personal assistant, resume writer, and job search organizer all in one.</strong><br><br>
            It doesn't just save me time - it helps me apply smarter, stay organized, and actually enjoy the job search process (as much as anyone can enjoy job searching! 😅).<br><br>
            And since it's all mine and runs locally, I have complete control and privacy. No subscriptions, no cloud services, just a powerful tool running on my computer.
        </div>

        <h2> Tech Details (For the Curious)</h2>

        <div class="tech-details">
            <p>If you're wondering about the tech:</p>
