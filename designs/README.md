# KervinApps Design Systems

Complete brand identity and UI specifications for all KervinApps applications, following professional development tool design principles.

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive design system specifications for each application in the KervinApps suite. Each design was created following the Designer Agent Prompt guidelines with strict adherence to professional, utilitarian aesthetics.

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Research-Based Design
Each design system incorporates principles from industry-leading development tools:
- **VS Code**: Semantic color usage for status and hierarchy
- **JetBrains IDEs**: Information density and clarity
- **GitHub Dark Mode**: Calibrated contrast ratios for extended viewing
- **Linear**: Status-driven visual design
- **Figma**: Clear navigation and wayfinding
- **DataDog**: Performance metric visualization

### 2. Core Constraints (Strictly Enforced)
- ❌ **NO EMOJIS** - Professional iconography only
- ❌ **NO PURPLE** - Avoided in all primary, secondary, and accent uses
- ❌ **NO GRADIENTS** - Flat colors with shadows and borders for depth

### 3. Color Philosophy
Colors are used **functionally**, not decoratively:
- Single sharp accent color per application (cyan, green, orange, lime)
- Deep charcoal/navy backgrounds for focus
- High-contrast text for readability
- Status colors indicate meaning (green = success, red = error, orange = attention)

### 4. Typography
- **Monospace** (SF Mono) for headings and technical content
- **System fonts** for body text and optimal readability
- Clear hierarchy through weight and size, not decoration
