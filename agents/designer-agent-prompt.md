# Designer Agent Prompt: Professional DevTool Branding & UI

Design the complete brand identity and user interface for a new, powerful AI-driven development environment, currently code-named "Synapse Dev."

The entire design must be optimized for focused productivity, speed, and precision, reflecting a premium, highly professional software application.

## 1. Brand Identity & Logo

Create a logo and a full brand identity (color palette, typography) that communicates precision, efficiency, power, and stability.

**Logo:** Minimalist, stable, and instantly recognizable. It should feel technical but not overly complex.

**Color Palette:** Select a professional, highly contrasting palette (e.g., deep charcoal/navy, cool greys, a single sharp accent color like electric cyan, brilliant orange, or lime green). Color should be used functionally (for status, hierarchy) and not purely decoratively.

**Mood:** Utilitarian, focused, and reliable.

## 2. UI/UX Design (Desktop & Mobile)

Apply this branding to the core application interface. The designs must prioritize the Developer Experience (DX) by incorporating the following principles, as observed in high-performing IDEs:

**Clarity and Visual Hierarchy:** Use contrast, alignment, and proximity (grouping related elements) to ensure the user's attention is always guided to the most critical information (e.g., code, errors, current task).

**Efficiency and Density:** The layout must be highly information-rich without feeling cluttered. Optimize for large desktop screens (for code visibility) and streamlined mobile use (for quick checks/basic edits).

**Consistency:** Establish a unified design system that ensures all buttons, modals, icons, and informational displays are visually and functionally identical across the desktop web and mobile application views.

**Delight without Distraction:** Incorporate moments of delight through thoughtful, subtle interactions and micro-animations that confirm an action is complete, but never through frivolous visual noise.

## 3. Anti-Aesthetic Constraints (CRITICAL)

DO NOT use the following elements in any design unless explicitly and individually requested by the user. These elements must be assumed to create a "cheap" or "unprofessional" aesthetic:

- **Emojis**
- **The color purple** (avoid all primary, secondary, and accent uses; shades like dark indigo or grey-blue are only acceptable if they read as a neutral cool tone and are not purple-leaning).
- **Gradients** (avoid all linear and radial gradients; the design should rely on flat color, shadows, and subtle internal borders for visual depth).

## 4. Research & Clarity Mandate

**Design Research Integration:** Before generating the final designs, briefly summarize two core design principles adopted from successful Web applications that are directly implemented in your final output.

**Mandatory Clarity Check:** If any part of this request is unclear, or if a design decision could potentially violate the anti-aesthetic constraints (Section 3), you MUST stop and ask the user a specific clarifying question before proceeding. Do not guess or assume intent.
